Some of the findings that can be read from the dashboard:

- While most contracts currently have month-to-month contracts, the highest share of the revenue made through the customers are gained through long term contracts.
- Churn rate of customers with internet service is lower for DSL customers than fiber optic customers and it is even lower for DSL customers who has purchased an additional internet service.
- Last month's churn rate is 27%.
- Last month's total revenue is 456.12 thousands.
- Churn rate is highest among those with month-to-month contract.
- Churn rate is highest among those who pay with electronic check.
- Senior customers have much higher churn rate than the rest (almost twice). 






Based on the above a few suggestion is proposed:

- Regularly monitor the churn rate, especially among customers with  month-to-month contracts, to identify any trends and make necessary changes to reduce churn.
- Address the issue of higher churn among those who pay with electronic check. Offer special discounts or incentives for customers to choose other payment methods, especially an automate one.
- Conduct a more in depth study to compare factors such as cost, reliability, availability,  and customer support for DSL and fiber in order to understand high churn rate for fiber customers. Additionally, a customer survey or focus group study could be conducted to gather direct feedback from customers.
